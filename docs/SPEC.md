Features:
* Enter current mortgage data (principal, years left, interest rate, base monthly payment of Principal + Interest)
* Enter monthly additional principal payment
* Enter one-time lump sum principal payment
* See numbers comparing how much faster the loan will be paid off (in years and months), how much interest is saved
* Optionally enter an investment scenario of the same monthly and lump sum payments and invest in X% yield accounts, that calculates estimated return and taxes (have an input for the withdrawl tax rate, default to 20% for long term cap gains). The investment should be calculated through the time it takes to pay off the mortgage with the faster time due to the monthly and lump-sum payments.
